==========

Experimental code for distributed embedded architectures.

The Arduino code is inspired by and forked from Ward Cunningham's Txtzyme https://github.com/WardCunningham/Txtzyme

We've added code that provides Python and Java DSLs on the Pi or Laptop, and 
generalising the mcirocontroller code to work on Arduino or teensy 2.0/3.0

We've added basic Servo control and will add PWM, LCD and I2C control.

We're also adding location and discovery services.
